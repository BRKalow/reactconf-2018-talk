## Let's talk about components

```notes
- Create speaker notes in fenced code blocks
```

---

export default Layout

## Components are...

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Declarative</li>
    <li>Predictable</li>
    <li>Composable</li>
    <li>Reusable</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

export default Layout

### Components allow us to compose rich user interfaces

```notes
Usually by visually rendering something
```

---

export default Layout

## Components also...

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Fetch data</li>
    <li>Add event listeners</li>
    <li>Handle navigation</li>
    <li>Manage state</li>
    <li>Transform data</li>
    <li>Set timers</li>
    <li>Control focus</li>
    <li>Track user interactions</li>
    <li>Inject scripts</li>
    <li>Handle scrolling</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

### We use the React lifecycle to control the execution flow of our applications

---

export default Layout

## And it works great, except...

---

export default Layout

## As time goes on, our lifecycle methods grow to encapsulate complex logic

```notes
That might not be related to enabling the component to render
```

---

export default Layout

## How can we orchestrate execution within the React lifecycle in a maintainable way?

ðŸ¤”

```notes
Abstracting lifecycle functionality into separate modules isn't always practical, often times
we are reliant on props and access to the component tree to do what we need to do.
```

---

export default Layout

## With components! ðŸŽ‰

---

export default Layout

## Components don't have to render anything

---

```js
class UnitOfWork extends Component {
  render() {
    return null;
  }
}
```

---

export default Layout

(I just rendered `<UnitOfWork />` ðŸ‘‡)

<UnitOfWork />

export default Layout

### What's the big deal?

---

export default Layout

### We can work within the React lifecycle

```notes
This is crucial for large React applications, as most things are dictated by and revolve around
the React component tree. Navigation, app state, and configuration are often all orchestrated by
some piece of React.
```

---

export default Layout

### With all the benefits of representing UI as components...

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Declarative</li>
    <li>Predictable</li>
    <li>Composable</li>
    <li>Reusable</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

export default Layout

## Demo

<ImpressionsManager>
  <span>Home views: <ImpressionsCounter page="home" /></span>
  <IncrementImpressions page="home" />
</ImpressionsManager>
---

export default Layout

## Some ways we use the pattern

* `<ClientVersionCheck />`
* `<InjectScript />`
* `<FetchGlobalDataFromService />`
* `<EventListener />`
* `<FontLoader />`
* `<GlobalStyles />`
* `<ScrollPositionManager />`

---

## In the wild

```notes
`react-router` uses this pattern quite a bit, the <Redirect /> component is an example of this.
```

> Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions.
